## Cortex Arena description
this project has been made in Unity to practice Neural Networks with Genetic Algortihm. 
There are 2 folders in the **Assets** folder:
 

 - **Game**: this folder is for files concerning the game itself such as bot controller script, scenes,sprites,prefabs etc
 -**NeuralNetwork** this folder acts as a workspace for developing neural network (same files as mentioned above)

This separation was made so that other people may add their folders and fight with other neural networks in the *'Arena'*, in which each player places their bots with already trained neural networks (with whichever way you choose).
more on the rules of matches here:

**Note:** this is something I don't want to call attention to.
